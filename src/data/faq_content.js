      question: "Why is tutoring necessary?",
      answer:
        "Australian day schools can be slow-paced and inconsistent. Especially at the VCE level, students often lack depth in understanding, exam strategies, and pacing.

    {
      question: "When is the best time to start tutoring?",
      answer:
        "The earlier, the better. Y1–Y6 builds habits and interest. Y7–Y9 is essential for core skill building. Y10–Y11 prepares students for VCE exams with structured exposure. Y12 requires intensive revision, high-frequency drills, and mock review. Students should start tutoring based on their goals and readiness.",

      question: "为什么要补习？",
      answer:
        "在澳洲，日校课程通常进度缓慢、评估形式多样，教师资质和资源分布也存在不小差异。尤其在VCE阶段，考试节奏紧凑、得分标准明确，学生如果仅依赖日校教学，往往会在知识理解深度、应试技巧、考试节奏上存在明显短板。系统化的补习不仅帮助学生提前接触考试思维、构建清晰知识体系，还能通过反复练习和针对性反馈稳步提升成绩、建立自信，让学习变得主动而高效。",

    {
      question: "什么时候开始补习合适？",
      answer:
        "越早规划，越有优势。Y1-6是养成好的学习习惯，建立良好思维方式，培养学习兴趣的阶段；Y7–Y9是打基础的黄金时期，为了适应高中跳跃式的高强度的学习，7-9年级的学习至关重要；Y10–Y11是过渡阶段，在Austin学生在Y10-11会非常系统的学习VCE的考试考点，为12年级的考试打下坚实基础；Y12是冲刺阶段，需要系统精讲+高频刷题+模考讲解。因此，我们建议学生可以根据自己的目标在自己适合的年级开始系统补习。",
