        Start building a decisive advantage for VCE Chemistry from Year 10!`,
      paragraph:
        `Austin’s Year 10 Chemistry is a transitional course carefully designed for students planning to pursue VCE Chemistry. It helps students consolidate core concepts, build a structured understanding of chemistry, and become familiar with the VCE exam format in advance.
        Unlike school programs that focus heavily on observational experiments, Austin’s curriculum combines theoretical understanding, exam-oriented training, and scientific thinking strategies. The course bridges school knowledge gaps while equipping students with the VCE mindset and problem-solving skills before entering Year 11.`,
