    title: "High-Standard Essay Refinement Process",
    description: [
      "One of the key factors for achieving high scores in the VCE English exam is receiving precise, personalised refinement and guidance for each essay. At Austin, our English team refines nearly a thousand student essays each year, ensuring that every essay is meticulously pol- ished word by word. Our teachers not only focus on improving language expression and optimising structure but also guide students to think critically, expand their viewpoints, and en- hance their writing logic.",
      "Austin teachers accurately predicted the essay topic, led students through practice, and meticu- lously refined this particular piece.",
      "At most day schools, essay corrections often only provide simple feedback. However, at Austin, we insist on in-depth revisions and one-on-one communication, helping students truly understand and improve their writing skills. We do not encourage rote memorisation, but instead, through a systematic revision process, we cultivate students‚Äô independent thinking and high-quality writing abilities.",
      "Our high-standard essay refinement process includes five core steps, ensuring that every student can achieve their best performance in SACs and exams.",
