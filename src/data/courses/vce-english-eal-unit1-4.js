At Austin Education, our Year 12 English courses are organised according to schools and specified texts, with separate classes for AA and Crafting courses rather than large mixed groups. This unique class division allows our teachers to gain an in-depth understanding of each school’s grading criteria, preferred arguments, and writing structures. As a result, during SAC-specific revision sessions, we are able to offer targeted strategies that precisely address the areas needed for improvement.
            Due to this teaching advantage, Austin Education students consistently excel in SACs, with most achieving A+ or Very High results. This precise teaching method ensures that each student can perform at their best in SACs, providing a strong foundation for their final VCE English scores.`,
