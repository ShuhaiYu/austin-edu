This unique class division allows our teachers to gain an in-depth understanding of each school’s grading criteria, preferred arguments, and writing structures. As a result, during SAC-specific revision sessions, we are able to offer targeted strategies that precisely address the areas needed for improvement. \nDue to this teaching advantage, Austin Education students consistently excel in SACs, with most achieving A+ or Very High results.
